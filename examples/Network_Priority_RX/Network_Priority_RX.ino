/**
 * This sketch demonstrates handling of external data
 *
 * RF24Network contains a buffer for storing user payloads that have been received via the network.update()
 * function. If using protocols like TCP/IP over RF24Network, the memory on small devices is very limited.
 * Instead of using the user-payload buffer for such large payloads, they can be designated as an
 * EXTERNAL_DATA_TYPE in the header.type field. This allows users to prioritize these payloads, as they are
 * often very large, and would take up most or all of the user data buffer.
 *
 * The network.update function will return immediately upon receiving a payload marked as EXTERNAL_DATA_TYPE
 * Users can then process the data immediately.
 * All other payload types are handled via the network.available() and network.read() functionality.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * The TX node will send normal user data designated with header.type = 33, along with additional data
 * marked as header.type = EXTERNAL_DATA_TYPE.
 * The RX node demonstrates how to handle such data, allowing separation of standard data that is processed
 * normally vs data that needs to be passed elsewhere, like network interface for TCP/IP packets.
 * These methods are used in RF24Gateway & RF24Ethernet TCP/IP libraries for nrf24l01+.
