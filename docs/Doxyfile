# Doxyfile 1.9.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Newly Optimized RF24Network Layer"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "2020 - Optimized RF24 Network Layer for NRF24L01 radios"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part
# of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to strip.
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which will
# be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
#
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES. 
STRIP_FROM_PATH        = ../

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice, VHDL,
# Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen. When specifying no_extension you should add
# * to the FILE_PATTERNS.
#
# Note see also the list of default file extension mappings.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      = ino=c

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# With the correct setting of option CASE_SENSE_NAMES doxygen will better be
# able to match the capabilities of the underlying filesystem. In case the
# filesystem is case sensitive (i.e. it supports files in the same directory
# whose names only differ in casing), the option must be set to YES to properly
# deal with such files in case they appear in the input. For filesystems that
# are not case sensitive the option should be be set to NO to properly deal with
# output files written for symbols that only differ in casing, such as for two
# classes, one named CLASS and the other named Class, and to also support
# references to files without having to specify the exact matching casing. On
# Windows (including Cygwin) and MacOS, users should typically set this option
# to NO, whereas on Linux or other Unix flavors it should typically be set to
# YES.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES


# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (detailed) documentation of file and class members alphabetically by member
# name. If set to NO, the members will appear in declaration order.
# The default value is: YES.

SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = NO

# If the SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME tag is set to YES, the class list will be sorted by
# fully-qualified names, including namespaces. If set to NO, the class list will
# be sorted only by class name, not including the namespace part.
# Note: This option is not very useful if HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES is set to YES.
# Note: This option applies only to the class list, not to the alphabetical
# list.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME     = YES


# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the todo
# list. This list is created by putting \todo commands in the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_TODOLIST      = NO

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated at
# the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES, the
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to YES then doxygen will immediately stop when
# a warning is encountered. If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to FAIL_ON_WARNINGS
# then doxygen will continue running as if WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to NO, but
# at the end of the doxygen process doxygen will return with a non-zero status.
# Possible values are: NO, YES and FAIL_ON_WARNINGS.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_AS_ERROR          = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = .. \
                         ./

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude
# certain files from those directories.
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       = bcm2835* \
                         *README.md

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

EXAMPLE_PATH           = ../examples \
                         ../examples_RPi

# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be
# searched for input files to be used with the \include or \dontinclude commands
# irrespective of the value of the RECURSIVE tag.
# The default value is: NO.

EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE      = YES

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = ../images

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = main_page.md

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# style sheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list). For an example see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-custom.css

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE tag can be used to specify if the generated HTML output should be rendered
# with a dark or light theme.
#
# Possible values are:
# - LIGHT always generate light mode output
# - DARK always generate dark mode output
# - AUTO_LIGHT automatically set the mode according to the user preference,
#   use light mode if no preference is set (the default)
# - AUTO_DARK automatically set the mode according to the user preference,
#   use dark mode if no preference is set
# - TOGGLE allow to user to switch between light and dark mode via a button.
#
# The default value is: AUTO_LIGHT.
#
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE = TOGGLE

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to YES can help to show when doxygen was last run and thus if the
# documentation is up to date.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_TIMESTAMP         = YES

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = YES

# When MathJax is enabled you need to specify the location relative to the HTML
# output directory using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option. The destination directory
# should contain the MathJax.js script. For instance, if the mathjax directory
# is located at the same level as the HTML output directory, then
# MATHJAX_RELPATH should be ../mathjax. The default value points to the MathJax
# Content Delivery Network so you can quickly see the result without installing
# MathJax. However, it is strongly recommended to install a local copy of
# MathJax from https://www.mathjax.org before deployment.
# The default value is: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@2.
# This tag requires that the tag USE_MATHJAX is set to YES.

MATHJAX_RELPATH        = http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the XML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_XML           = YES

# The XML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the XML pages will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: xml.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_OUTPUT             = sphinx/xml

# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES, doxygen will dump the program
# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = NO

# If the XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE tag is set to YES, doxygen will include
# namespace members in file scope as well, matching the HTML output.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

PREDEFINED             = DOXYGEN_FORCED
